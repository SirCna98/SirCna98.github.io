You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

We all see lots of numbers and things happening every day. It can be hard to understand it all. So, we make pictures out of these numbers to help us see what's going on. Let me tell you about three kinds of pictures that do just that.

First, we've got a picture that's like a calendar. It's full of little boxes for each day. But instead of words, there are colors. These colors change if something special happens. If a lot of something happens, like people buying stuff, the box might be a dark color. If not much happens, the box might be light. This helps us see what days are busy or quiet over many years. It's a way to look back and remember what happened when.

Now, let's talk about the second picture. It's a map with red dots. This map is of a city, a place where people live and work. Each red dot stands for something that happened there. Where you see lots of red dots close together, that's where a lot of stuff goes on. Maybe that's where most people like to hang out, or it's a busy part of the city with lots of cars and buses. This map helps us see where the busy spots are.

Last, there's a picture with bars. Each bar is for one hour of the day. Some bars are tall; this means in that hour, many things happened. Maybe it's when people are going to work or school. Other bars are short; not much happened then. This might be late at night when most people are home. It's a good way to see when things get busy or quiet in a city.

All these pictures are like stories. They don't use words but they tell us a lot. The calendar shows us how things change day by day. The map with dots shows us where things happen. And the bars show us when things happen. These pictures make it easier for us to see patterns. We can look at them and understand better what's going on around us. And when we understand, we can make better choices or find out more about our city.
